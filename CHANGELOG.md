# @juun-roh/cesium-utils

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 35fc8f3: Test Expansion

  test: Test expansion

  - Add object tracking optimization tests for both `SurfaceHighlight` and `SilhouetteHighlight`.

  - Add return type test for `Collection`.

- 94ac8a5: Highlight Performance Optimization

  fix: Eliminate flickering and delay in mouse movement highlighting

  - Add object tracking to both `SurfaceHighlight` and `SilhouetteHighlight` classes.
    The classes now track the currently highlighted object and options to prevent redundant geometry updates.

  - Skip geometry clearing and recreation when highlighting the same object with identical options.
    This eliminates the flickering effect during rapid mouse movements over the same entity.

  - Implement robust comparison of `HighlightOptions` including proper color equality checks.
    Handle edge cases with undefined colors and default values correctly.

  - Add proper cleanup of tracking state in `hide()` and `destroy()` methods.
    Clear tracking variables on error conditions to prevent stale state.

  - Add `currentObject` getter to both highlight classes for debugging and state inspection.

- 539d646: Update Return Values for Collection Methods

  refactor: Update return values

  - `Collection` class methods:
    `add`, `remove` methods now return `this`
    to support method chaining.

  - `TerrainAreaCollection` class methods:
    Likewise, `add` method now returns `this`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 59b41d0: Collection Caching Strategy Improvement

  perf: Improve caching strategy

  - Add event-driven caching strategy.
    The caching strategy takes advantage of
    Cesium collections' internal events,
    such as `collectionChanged` in `EntityCollection`.
    The cache will be created when the `values()` method is called,
    invalidated whenever the underlying collection event is provoked.

  - Remove the individual calls of `_invalidateCache`.
    This may be restored in the future, for the sake of defensive programming.

  - Add an instance clean up process.

  - Update test to cover newly implemented caching feature.

- c8605db: Collection Types Reorganization

  refactor: Collection types reorganization

  - `CesiumCollection`:
    Narrowed it down to 4 types from various collection types, since other items (such as `Billboard`, `Label`) are eventually added to `viewer.primitives`.

  - `Primitives`:
    Likewise, this type has expanded to contain more collection item types.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7ba085c: Bug Fix

  fix: Model entity highlight

  - Setting `entity.model.silhouetteColor` to `undefined` does not properly remove the applied silhouette color.
    Restore setting it from `undefined` to `Color.TRANSPARENT`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cd18941: Release 3D Object Highlight

  feat: 3d object highlight

  - Complete test on highlight class.
    3D Highlight supports:
    `Cesium3DTileFeature` which is returned by `scene.pick()` on `Cesium3DTileset` object.
    `Entity` with specified `model` property.
    3D Highlight supports outline style only.

  - Both surface and silhouette only supports single highlighting feature currently.

### Patch Changes

### Patch Changes

  To support highlighting 3D objects, the class has been redefined.

  - Separate multiton handler as a wrapper of the former Highlight class.
    The former class is renamed as `SurfaceHighlight`.
    The former class is now a member of new wrapper class `Highlight`.

  - Add `SilhouetteHighlight` class to handle 3d objects.
    This class is able to display outlined highlights on `Cesium3DTileFeature` and `Model` objects.
    Also a member of new wrapper class `Highlight`.

  NOTE: Feature migration is under process. There are some mismatches and missing parts in documents and tests.

## 0.0.15

    - `_viewerEntities` to `_entities`

    Remove validation about `_entity` is defined.
    `_entity` is initialized in constructor, thus there is no need to check if the `_entity` is `undefined`.

  - Test coverage improvements:
    Now the highlight test is covered 100%.

## 0.0.13

### Patch Changes

- b702387: Lightweight Highlight Implementation

  refactor: Replace collection-based highlight with flyweight pattern

  - Architectural Changes
    Flyweight Pattern: Implement the flyweight pattern with a single entity per viewer instance instead of creating a new entity for each highlight.
    Memory Efficiency: Remove the entity collection and active highlights tracking, dramatically reducing memory overhead.
    Property-based Updates: Use Cesium's property system to update the highlight entity in-place rather than creating new entities.

  - API Improvements
    Type Safety: Add proper TypeScript method overloads for the \_update method, making the API more type-safe.
    Better Error Handling: Improve error handling throughout the class to prevent failures when working with complex geometries.
    Rename Methods: Change method names to better reflect their function.

  >     `add` → `show`
  >     `remove` → `hide`
  >     `removeAll` → now handled by hide
  >     `_createEntity` → `_update`

  - Feature Enhancements
    Geometry Cleanup: Properly clear all geometries between highlights to prevent artifacts.
    Outline Support: Add comprehensive support for outline-style highlighting across all geometry types.
    Improved Primitive Support: Better handling of GroundPrimitives with proper position extraction.
    Efficient Property Cloning: Properly preserve important properties from source geometries like heightReference and classificationType.

  - Internal Improvements
    Simplified State Management: Remove the need to track active highlights with a Set.
    Direct Entity Access: Add a highlightEntity getter for direct access to the highlight entity.
    Better Instance Management: More robust multiton pattern implementation with proper cleanup.
    Optimized Reuse: The single entity is reused for all geometry types by selectively applying only the needed properties.
